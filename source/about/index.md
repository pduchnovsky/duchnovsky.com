<H5>Who am I ?</H5>
One day, this section will contain some more information about me ;)

<H5>Photography</H5>
I started taking photos as an amateur around 2011 when I bought my first Nikon SLR camera and after few years I  entered the world of mirrorless with the Sony brand, in 2019 I purchased my first Sony ‘full frame’ camera.
Over the years, I've taken thousands of photos with Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm cameras and learned a lot, but like everyone else, I still have a lot to learn.<br>
Photography is mainly a hobby for me, but I am open to cooperation and customers who would be interested in my services.<br>
I will be happy to help you transform your ideas into reality :)
