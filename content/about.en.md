{{< notice info >}}
Throughout my career, I have primarily focused on **private cloud environments**, transitioning through various technical and managerial roles. I began as a **System Administrator**, responsible for managing storage and Unix systems. Later, I moved into an **ICT Engineer** role, where I specialized in **automation** and script development. Eventually, I took on the role of **Operations Manager** in the cloud deployment domain, ensuring operational stability and driving process improvements.

Over time, I realized that my true passion lies in **technical work**. As a result, I shifted my career path and joined a **market research startup** as a **DevOps Engineer**. In this role, I automated and managed a platform built on **GPU-accelerated Machine Learning (ML/AI)**. I later worked as a **Senior DevOps Engineer** for an IT services provider, contributing to various projects in the **public cloud** space.

I am currently working as a **Site Reliability Engineer** in the **banking sector** :)

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a passionate **technology enthusiast**. I enjoy exploring **home automation** (mainly with Home Assistant and other tools), and I love managing my own **home server and network stack**. I **self-host** several services across two physical servers. I used to be a dedicated **gamer**, and I'm also a hobbyist **photographer** with over a decade of experience. In my free time, I enjoy **running**, **cycling**, and the occasional **ski trip**.

Most importantly, I'm a proud father of two **amazing kids**, who are my greatest source of joy and inspiration :)

This website serves as both my **blog and portfolio**, where I share insights, guides, and other content I believe is worth sharing.

**I hope you find something useful here ðŸŒŸ**
