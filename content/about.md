{{< notice info >}}
Throughout my career, I have primarily focused on private cloud environments, transitioning through various roles over the years. I began as a **System Administrator**, responsible for managing storage and Unix systems. Later, I shifted to an **ICT Engineer** role, where I specialized in automation and script development. Subsequently, I took on the position of **Operation Manager** in the cloud deployment domain, ensuring operational efficiency and process enhancements.

However, I eventually realized that my true passion lay in technical pursuits. Consequently, I made a career shift and joined a market research startup as a **DevOps Engineer**. In this role, I automated and managed a platform utilizing GPU Accelerated Machine Learning (ML/AI).

Currently, I serve as a **Senior DevOps Engineer** at a â€˜Full Stackâ€™ IT Services provider.

Beyond my professional life, I am an avid **computer enthusiast**, I'm very in to **home automation** using Home Assistant and other tools, I love managing my small servers and network stack while **selfhostng** several services spread over two physical servers, I used to be a dedicated **gamer**, and I am a hobbyist **photographer** with over a decade of experience. In my leisure time, I enjoy running, cycling and occasionally skiing.

Lastly, I take immense pride in being a father.

This website serves as both my blog and portfolio, where I share insights, guides, and other valuable content.

I hope you find something useful here ðŸŒŸ
