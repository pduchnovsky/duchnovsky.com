{{< notice info >}}
Most of my working time I spent in a private cloud area where over the years I moved between several different positions.

Starting as a **System Administrator** where I took care of storage and Unix systems, and later on moving to an **ICT Engineer** role where I was automating and developing scripts, then switching direction and working as an **Operation Manager** for cloud deployment area taking care of smoothness of operations and improving processes among of other things.  
After some time I decided that wasn't for me and I decided to go back to my 'technical' roots, therefore I switched careers and started as a **DevOps Engineer** for a market research startup where I worked on automating and management of a platform that used GPU Accelerated Machine Learning.

I am currently working as a **Senior DevOps Engineer** for 'Full Stack' IT Services provider.

For my personal hobbies - I could say I am also a huge Nerd into computers, an **avid Gamer** and finally a **Hobbyist Photographer** with over 10 years of experience. When it comes to sports, I like to run and sometimes ski.

At last, but not least, I am proud father :)

This web serves as my blog / portfolio where I'll share some insights, guides, and some other stuff I might find worth sharing.

I hope you will find something that helps you here and go on with your life peacefully :)
